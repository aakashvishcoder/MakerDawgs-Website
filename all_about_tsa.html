            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://tsaweb.org/tsa">Technology Student Association (TSA)</a> enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.</p>
            <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
            <p>TSA is accelerating student achievement and supporting teachers by providing engaging opportunities to develop STEM skills.</p>
            <h2>Motto</h2>
            <p>Learning to lead in a technical world.</p>
            <h2>Creed</h2>
            <p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live.
I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.</p>

            <p>Through TSAâ€™s competitions, student members have the opportunity to develop real-world skills, strengthen their leadership abilities, and explore career opportunities.   In addition to the National Qualification Events (NQE), we also have events that are Unique to Texas (UTE).   UTE events are generally easier and less expensive.  However, they culminate instate competition and do not lead to national competitions.   First-timers might find it easier to focus on the UTE events.</p>
            <a href="https://tsaweb.org/students#competitions" class="btn" target="_blank">TSA Competitions</a>
            <p>These are the NQE Events.   For each of these, there are rules, and most have themes.  You must understand both the maximum number of people per team as well as the maximum teams per chapter.</p>
